- **Task Timers**: Track time spent on individual tasks (Start/Pause/Reset).
- **Time Tracking**: View cumulative time spent on specific tasks and the daily total.
- **User Authentication**: Secure Login and Registration system.
- **Persistent Data**: All data is saved locally to `data.json`.
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.8 or higher**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - *Verify installation:* Open a terminal and run `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
2. **Git (Optional)**: To clone the repository.
3. **A Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.

---

## 🚀 How to Run (Detailed Guide)

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your machine.

### Step 1: Get the Code
Download the project files to a folder on your computer. If you have Git installed:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd todo-app

```

Or simply extract the zip file if you downloaded it manually.

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

**On Windows:**

```powershell
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
venv\Scripts\activate

```

**On macOS / Linux:**

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

```

*You should see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt.*

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries (Flask, Flask-CORS, etc.) using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Step 4: Start the Server

Run the Flask application backend.

```bash
python app.py

```

You should see output similar to:

```text
 * Running on [http://0.0.0.0:5000/](http://0.0.0.0:5000/) (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!

```

### Step 5: Access the Application

1. Open your web browser.
2. Go to: **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)**
3. You will be greeted by a **Login/Register** screen.
* Since this is your first time, click **"Create Account"**.
* Enter an email and password to register.
* Once registered, switch to **Log In** and enter your credentials.

## 🔌 API Reference

The backend exposes a RESTful API for managing tasks and projects.

**Base URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api`

### Auth

* `POST /register`: Create a new user (`{email, password}`).
* `POST /login`: Authenticate user (`{email, password}`).
* `GET /me`: Get current session info.

### Projects

* `GET /projects`: List all projects for the logged-in user.
* `POST /projects`: Create a project (`{name}`).
* `DELETE /projects/<id>`: Delete a project and its tasks.

### Todos

* `GET /todos`: Get all tasks.
* `POST /todos`: Create a task (`{item, project_id}`).
* `PUT /todos/<id>`: Update task status or text.
* `POST /todos/<id>/action`: Control timer (`{action: "start"|"pause"|"reset"}`).
* `DELETE /todos/<id>`: Remove a task.

### Stats

* `GET /total-time`: Get total time spent across all tasks.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**1. "Python is not recognized" error:**
Make sure you checked "Add Python to PATH" during installation. You may need to use `python3` instead of `python` on macOS/Linux.

**2. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'"**
This means dependencies weren't installed. Ensure your virtual environment is active (see Step 2) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

**3. Port 5000 is already in use:**
If you cannot start the server because the port is taken, open `app.py` and change the line:
`app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)`
to a different port, e.g., `port=5001`. Then access `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.
